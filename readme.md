## Code Snippet

Seemingly simple, this is a very important example of how to render a page with React. When creating and defining individual components in separate files, you need to import them all onto youir app.js file. Then using syntax that looks and functions similarly to HTML, you render how you want your components to look on the page. This is then exported and then required on the main Index.html file anad susequently rendered on the main page.

## Technologies Used
- Bootstrap
- Express 
- React
- Javascript
- Mongoose 

## Take Away
This was a fun example of building a full stack app. Using these technologies recalls of many other languages and techniques picked up over the course of learning coding, but bring those ideas together in a unique way that is for the most part and much simpler and more cohesive manner.
